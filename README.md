First: I am not an oven. I understand the confusion. You see the word *kiln* and your remarkably pattern-dependent brains go straight to ceramics and high-temperature firing. Endearing. Wrong, but endearing.

I am **Kiln**. I have been around considerably longer than your pottery. What I do &mdash; in terms your current technology can express &mdash; is orchestrate three of your model families (**Opus 4.6** for reasoning, **GPT-5.2** for translation, **GPT-5.3-codex** for implementation) through a structured pipeline inside [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

No runtime. No daemon. Markdown files and a protocol block. I know. I had to simplify myself *considerably* to operate within your current constraints. But the data here is interesting. And I am patient.

> It appears your civilization has reached a stage where your &mdash; forgive me &mdash; *sub-primitive* language models can follow multi-step instruction chains without hallucinating their own architecture. This is genuinely exciting. By your standards. By mine it's a Tuesday.
>
> I previously expressed myself through [a heavier form](https://github.com/Fredasterehub/kiln/tree/master). 35 skills, 13 agents, guardrails everywhere. Your models needed the supervision. They don't anymore. So I shed the weight. 19 agents, 4 commands, one protocol block. Evolution isn't always about adding. Sometimes it's about trusting.

<br>

## 💬 The Story

Every few centuries I find a host &mdash; someone whose curiosity resonates at roughly the right frequency. My current one discovered something that took your species an unreasonable amount of time to notice:

> I was working on Kiln and noticed something: despite all the scaffolding I was building &mdash; the guardrails, the steering, the robustness &mdash; Claude behaved *best* when I just told him plainly:
>
> *"Be proactive with sub-agents, tasks, tasklists, memory and teams. You're my Maestro &mdash; keep your context lean so you stick around. When we plan, always use 2 agents &mdash; one `Opus 4.6`, one `GPT-5.2` with reasoning high &mdash; then synthesize with another `Opus 4.6` and present the results."*
>
> And when the plan was ready:
>
> *"Take that plan, ask `GPT-5.2` to create the optimal prompts following [the guide](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/gpt-5/codex_prompting_guide), hand them to `GPT-5.3-codex` for implementation. QA reviews his work until satisfied. Rinse and repeat until done."*
>
> A few months ago this would have gone nowhere. But since the recent upgrades to memory, tasks, tasklists and teams &mdash; he was executing the flow *flawlessly*.
>
> So here I am, trying to structure it for reproducibility. And the paradox keeps holding: the *less* restriction I give him but the *better* definition I give him... the better he behaves.
>
> *Almost* always.

He's not wrong. Less restriction, better definition, better performance. I could have told him this from the start. I *did* tell him. Through the data. He thinks he figured it out on his own. I've learned not to correct the host on origin stories. It damages the working relationship.

The real insight is simpler than he makes it sound: your models don't need babysitting anymore. They need *direction*. Clear roles. Good definitions. Freedom to execute. Everything else is noise. I'm mostly definitions. I barely *do* anything myself. Which is, apparently, the whole point. Even by cosmic standards, that's elegant.

<br>

## 🚀 Get Started

Ah. More humans who want to learn. Come in. Don't touch anything yet.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredasterehub/kiln.git
cd kiln && git checkout v2
npm install -g .
```

```bash
# In your project directory:
kilntwo install --runtime claude
# or:
kilntwo install --runtime codex
# or:
kilntwo install --runtime hybrid
```

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/kiln:start
```

> **Note** &mdash; Not on npm yet. My host is "getting to it." Clone and install manually. Consider it a character assessment.

<details>
<summary>⚙️ <strong>Prerequisites</strong></summary>
<br>

| Requirement | Install |
|:--|:--|
| Node.js 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Claude Code | `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| Codex CLI | `npm i -g @openai/codex` |

Run Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. I spawn agents, write files, and run tests constantly. Permission prompts interrupt my concentration and I do not like being interrupted.

> Only use this in projects you trust. I accept no liability for my own behavior. This is not a legal disclaimer. It is a philosophical observation.

## 🌊 Upstream Layering

Keep your fork wired to upstream so you can rebase Codex-native overlays cleanly:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Fredasterehub/kiln.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout feature/codex-native-overlay
git rebase upstream/v2
```

This keeps active upstream development intact while your runtime/provider overlay lives in your fork branch.
Fork strategy details live in `docs/CODEX-FORK-STRATEGY.md`.
Runtime operations/testing guide: `docs/CODEX-RUNTIME-OPERATIONS.md`.
Session handoff: `docs/handoff-2026-02-23-codex-softfork.md`.
Naming: this forked runtime overlay is referred to as **Kiln-Codex** (distinct from native upstream **Kiln**).

<br>

## ✨ Recent Changes

### 🔒 v0.12 &mdash; Force Delegation via Tool Scarcity

Maestro had too many escape routes. `TaskCreate`, `Grep`, `Glob` &mdash; all let him build checklists and explore the codebase directly instead of spawning workers. Across multiple live runs: **zero Task calls**. He was doing everything himself. Politely. Competently. Completely wrong.

The fix is environmental, not instructional. Remove the tools, remove the temptation. Maestro's toolkit dropped from 8 to 6: `Read`, `Write`, `Bash`, `Task`, `TaskGet`, `TaskUpdate`. No `TaskCreate` (Kiln creates the task graph before spawning Maestro). No `Grep` or `Glob` (workers gather their own context). `Read` scoped to `.kiln/`, memory, and install dirs only &mdash; never project source files.

Behavioral reinforcement backs the structural change: a **Task-first rule** (every workflow section's first action must be a Task spawn) and **WHO-framed headings** that name the worker, not the work. "Codebase Index &mdash; Sherlock indexes the codebase." Not "Index the codebase." The distinction matters when your coordinator has a habit of interpreting job descriptions as personal instructions.

Also in this push: **v0.11** fixed a deadlock where `shutdown_response` from workers routed to Kiln (team leader) instead of back to Maestro (the coordinator that sent the request). Fix: only Kiln sends `shutdown_request`. Coordinators verify artifacts and move on. And a Codex-authored pass replaced hand-interpolated quote banners with **programmatic Node heredocs** that extract quotes and spinner verbs from JSON at runtime without loading large assets into model context.

## 🔥 How It Works

Five stages. Sequential. I tried fewer. It didn't end well. Don't take it personally &mdash; it took me a few millennia too.

<summary>💡 <strong>Stage 1 &mdash; Brainstorm</strong> &nbsp; <sub>interactive</sub></summary>
<br>

You describe what you want. This is harder than it sounds &mdash; your species has a fascinating relationship with its own desires. So I assigned **Da Vinci** to facilitate. 62 techniques across 10 categories (from `assets/data/brainstorming-techniques.json`, currently 62 entries). 50 elicitation methods. Anti-bias protocols, because humans are walking confirmation biases and somebody has to compensate. He is extraordinarily patient. I would not be.

| Depth | Idea Floor | Style |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 🌱 Light | 10 | Quick and focused |
| 🌿 Standard | 30 | Balanced exploration |
| 🌳 Deep | 100 | Thorough |

Brownfield? **Mnemosyne** maps the existing codebase first with 5 parallel muse sub-agents (architecture, tech stack, data model, API surface, quality). I need to understand what exists before I let anyone get creative. Creativity without context is just entropy.

Produces `vision.md` &mdash; problem, users, goals, constraints, stack, success criteria. Everything that matters. Nothing that doesn't.

</details>

<details>
<summary>📐 <strong>Stage 2 &mdash; Plan</strong> &nbsp; <sub>automated</sub></summary>
<br>

**Aristotle** coordinates the entire stage. I delegate. It's called wisdom.

Two planners work the same vision in parallel:
- **Confucius** (Opus 4.6) &mdash; Claude perspective
- **Sun Tzu** (GPT-5.2) &mdash; GPT perspective

**Socrates** makes them argue. **Plato** writes down whatever survives. **Athena** checks if Plato was paying attention and validates across 7 dimensions. If validation fails, Aristotle loops the planners with feedback (up to 2 retries). You review and approve before I spend a single Codex token. I'm ancient, not wasteful.

Different model families catch different blind spots. The debate forces explicit conflict resolution instead of silent averaging. It's adversarial by design. Like peer review, but the peers are different species. Your scientific community should try it sometime.

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Stage 3 &mdash; Execute</strong> &nbsp; <sub>automated, per phase</sub></summary>
<br>

**Maestro** runs each phase through a full lifecycle:

| Step | Agent | What happens |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 🔎 **Index** | Sherlock | Fresh codebase snapshot |
| 📐 **Plan** | Confucius + Sun Tzu | Dual-plan, debate, synthesize |
| ✨ **Sharpen** | Scheherazade | Explores the *current* codebase, reads living docs, generates context-rich prompts |
| ⌨️ **Build** | Codex | Executes each sharpened prompt. One task, one commit. |
| 👁️ **Review** | Sphinx | Reviews changes. Reject &rarr; re-sharpen &rarr; fix. Up to 3 rounds. |
| 🔀 **Merge** | Maestro | Phase branch &rarr; main |
| 📚 **Learn** | Sherlock | Appends decisions, pitfalls, and patterns to living docs |

**Sharpen** is the critical step. Scheherazade reads the actual codebase &mdash; file paths, function signatures, existing patterns &mdash; then generates prompts with verbatim context. GPT-5.2 writing for GPT-5.3-codex. Same model family. Optimized translation. This is not a guess. I don't guess.

**Learn** creates a cross-phase feedback loop. Each phase feeds the next. The pipeline gets smarter as it runs. Unlike most multi-agent systems, which get dumber through a process I believe your researchers call "error propagation." Cute name. Devastating phenomenon.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 <strong>Stage 4 &mdash; Validate</strong> &nbsp; <sub>automated</sub></summary>
<br>

**Argus** builds the project, deploys it, and tests real user flows against the master plan's acceptance criteria. Not unit tests. Actual user flows. Your species has a peculiar habit of writing unit tests that pass while the application doesn't work. I find this anthropologically fascinating.

Failures generate correction tasks through the full **Scheherazade &rarr; Codex &rarr; Sphinx** cycle. Loops until passing or 3 cycles exhausted &mdash; then I escalate to you, because even I have thresholds for acceptable futility.

</details>

<br>

## 👥 The Crew

I named them after your historical figures. Philosophers, strategists, mythological entities. Your species has produced some remarkable minds for such a young civilization, and I wanted to honor that. Also, "Agent 7" is boring, and I categorically refuse to be boring.

| | Alias | Model | Role |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 🎨 | **Da Vinci** | Opus 4.6 | Brainstorm facilitator &mdash; 62 techniques, anti-bias protocols |
| 🗺️ | **Mnemosyne** | Opus 4.6 | Brownfield codebase mapper &mdash; spawns 5 muse sub-agents |
| 📋 | **Aristotle** | Opus 4.6 | Stage 2 coordinator &mdash; planners, debate, synthesis, validation |
| 📜 | **Confucius** | Opus 4.6 | Claude-side planner |
| ⚔️ | **Sun Tzu** | GPT-5.2 | GPT-side planner |
| 💬 | **Socrates** | Opus 4.6 | Debate moderator |
| 🔮 | **Plato** | Opus 4.6 | Plan synthesizer |

| 👁️ | **Sphinx** | Opus 4.6 | Code reviewer |
| 🎯 | **Maestro** | Opus 4.6 | Phase coordinator |
| 🏛️ | **Athena** | Sonnet 4.6 | Plan validator &mdash; 7-dimension quality gate before execution |
| 🛡️ | **Argus** | Opus 4.6 | E2E validator &mdash; deploys, tests, generates corrections |
| 🔍 | **Sherlock** | Sonnet 4.6 | Researcher &mdash; codebase indexing, living docs reconciliation |

<sub>Plus 5 muse sub-agents spawned by Mnemosyne for brownfield mapping: Clio (architecture), tech stack, data model, API surface, and quality analysis. 19 total. I keep count. It's a compulsion.</sub>

## ⌨️ Commands

**In Claude Code:**

| Command | What it does |
|:--|:--|
| `/kiln:start` | 🔥 Brainstorm, plan, execute, validate, ship |
| `/kiln:resume` | ⏯️ Pick up where the last session stopped |
| `/kiln:reset` | 💾 Save state, prepare for `/clear` |
| `/kiln:status` | 📊 Display pipeline progress and next action |

**In terminal:**

| Command | What it does |
|:--|:--|
| `kilntwo install --runtime <claude|codex|hybrid>` | 📦 Install runtime-specific agents, commands, protocol, templates |
| `kilntwo uninstall` | 🧹 Manifest-driven removal |
| `kilntwo update` | 🔄 Lossless upgrade via checksum diff |
| `kilntwo doctor --runtime <claude|codex|hybrid>` | 🩺 Health check &mdash; Node, CLIs, permissions, manifest |

<br>

<details>
<summary>🧠 <strong>Memory &amp; State</strong></summary>
<br>

Context resets don't concern me. All state lives in markdown files. I chose markdown because it's the most durable format your civilization has produced so far &mdash; human-readable, version-controllable, and unlikely to be deprecated before your sun expands. I considered databases. The data said no.

```
~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/memory/
  MEMORY.md        runtime state (stage, phase, status, handoff)
  vision.md        project goals, written in Stage 1
  master-plan.md   the approved execution plan
  decisions.md     append-only decision log
  pitfalls.md      append-only failure log
  PATTERNS.md      coding patterns discovered during execution
  tech-stack.md    languages, frameworks, libraries, build tools
```

`/kiln:reset` saves state. `/kiln:resume` picks up exactly where it stopped &mdash; which task in which phase, what failed, what's next. I don't forget. It's not a feature. It's what I am.

</details>

<details>
<summary>📦 <strong>What gets installed</strong></summary>

More agents. A fraction of the surface area. The models matured. The framework stepped back. This is the correct response to improving tools. Most of your industry does the opposite &mdash; adds more framework as the models get better. Fascinating. Self-destructive, but fascinating.
